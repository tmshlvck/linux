Turris Mox module configuration bus (over SPI)

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "cznic,moxtet".
 - #address-cells	: Has to be 1
 - #size-cells		: Has to be 0
For other required and optional properties of SPI slave
nodes please refer to ../spi/spi-bus.txt.

Required properties of subnodes:
 - reg			: Should be position on the Moxtet bus
 - moxtet,id		: Should be ID of the Moxtet device connected

The driver finds the devices connected to the bus by itself, but it may be
needed to reference some of them from other parts of the device tree. In that
case the devices can be defined as subnodes of the moxtet node.

Example:

	moxtet@1 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "cznic,moxtet";
		reg = <1>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		spi-cpol;
		spi-cpha;

		moxtet_sfp: moxtet-sfp@0 {
			compatible = "cznic,moxtet-sfp";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells;
			reg = <0>;
			moxtet,id = <1>;
		}
	};
